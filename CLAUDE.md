OverHere is a mobile-first, hyper-local app for spontaneous real-world conversations. Users check in at physical locations, see others nearby, and can initiate ephemeral messaging sessions.

## Code Editing Policy

**By default, do NOT apply changes to the repository.**

When suggesting code changes:
- Provide **complete, copy-pasteable code blocks** (not diff/patch format)
- Clearly indicate **which file** the code belongs in and **where** it should be inserted or replaced
- Prefer showing the **full updated function/component** when modifying existing code

Only use diff format or ask to apply changes directly if I explicitly say:
- "apply these changes"
- "update the file for me"
- "go ahead and edit the code"

If instructions are ambiguous, assume I want to manually copy/paste the code myself.
